#define NO_ERROR (0)

// ======= Internal failures =======
// ERR_INTERNAL: The system encountered an otherwise unspecified error while performing the operation.
#define ERR_INTERNAL (-1)

// ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED: The operation is not implemented, supported, or enabled.
#define ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED (-2)

// ERR_NO_RESOURCES: The system was not able to allocate some resource needed for the operation.
#define ERR_NO_RESOURCES (-5)

// ERR_NO_MEMORY: The system was not able to allocate memory needed for the operation.
#define ERR_NO_MEMORY (-4)

// ======= Parameter errors =======
// ERR_INVALID_ARGS: an argument is invalid, ex. null pointer
#define ERR_INVALID_ARGS (-10)

// ERR_WRONG_TYPE: The subject of the operation is the wrong type to perform the operation.
// Example: Attempting a message_read on a thread handle.
#define ERR_WRONG_TYPE (-54)

// ERR_BAD_SYSCALL: The specified syscall number is invalid.
#define ERR_BAD_SYSCALL (-11)

// ERR_BAD_HANDLE: A specified handle value does not refer to a handle.
#define ERR_BAD_HANDLE (-12)

// ERR_OUT_OF_RANGE: An argument is outside the valid range for this operation.
#define ERR_OUT_OF_RANGE (-13)

// ERR_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL: A caller provided buffer is too small for this operation.
#define ERR_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL (-14)

// ======= Precondition or state errors =======
// ERR_BAD_STATE: operation failed because the current state of the object does not allow it,
// or a precondition of the operation is not satisfied
#define ERR_BAD_STATE (-20)

// ERR_NOT_FOUND: The requested entity is not found.
#define ERR_NOT_FOUND (-3)

// ERR_ALREADY_EXISTS: An object with the specified identifier already exists.
// Example: Attempting to create a file when a file already exists with that name.
#define ERR_ALREADY_EXISTS (-15)

// ERR_ALREADY_BOUND: The operation failed because the named entity is already owned or controlled
// by another entity. The operation could succeed later if the current owner releases the entity.
#define ERR_ALREADY_BOUND (-16)

// ERR_TIMED_OUT: The time limit for the operation elapsed before the operation completed.
#define ERR_TIMED_OUT (-23)

// ERR_HANDLE_CLOSED: a handle being waited on was closed
#define ERR_HANDLE_CLOSED (-24)

// ERR_REMOTE_CLOSED: The operation failed because the remote end of the subject of the operation
// was closed.
#define ERR_REMOTE_CLOSED (-25)

// ERR_UNAVAILABLE: The subject of the operation is currently unable to perform the operation.
// Note: This is used when there's no direct way for the caller to observe when the subject will
// be able to perform the operation and should thus retry.
#define ERR_UNAVAILABLE (-26)    // NEW

// ERR_SHOULD_WAIT: The operation cannot be performed currently but potentially could succeed if
// the caller waits for a prerequisite to be satisfied, for example waiting for a handle to be
// readable or writable.
// Example: Attempting to read from a message pipe that has no messages waiting but has an open
// remote will return **SHOULD\_WAIT**. Attempting to read from a message pipe that has no
// messages waiting and has a closed remote end will return **REMOTE\_CLOSED**.
#define ERR_SHOULD_WAIT (-27)

// ======= Permission check errors =======
// ERR_ACCESS_DENIED: The caller did not have permission to perform the specified operation.
#define ERR_ACCESS_DENIED (-30)

// ======= Input-output errors =======
// ERR_IO: Otherwise unspecified error occurred during I/O.
#define ERR_IO (-40)

// ERR_REFUSED: The entity the I/O operation is being performed on rejected the operation.
// Example: an I2C device NAK'ing a transaction or a disk controller rejecting an invalid command.
#define ERR_IO_REFUSED (-41)

// ERR_IO_DATA_INTEGRITY: The data in the operation failed an integrity check and is possibly
// corrupted.
// Example: CRC or Parity error.
#define ERR_IO_DATA_INTEGRITY (-42)

// ERR_IO_DATA_LOSS: The data in the operation is currently unavailable and may be permanently
// lost.
// Example: A disk block is irrecoverably damaged.
#define ERR_IO_DATA_LOSS (-43)

// Filesystem specific errors
#define ERR_BAD_PATH (-50)
#define ERR_NOT_DIR (-51)
#define ERR_NOT_FILE (-52)
// TODO: Confusing name - is this the same as POSIX ELOOP?
#define ERR_RECURSE_TOO_DEEP (-53)
