// ======= Internal failures =======
// ERR_INTERNAL: The system encountered an otherwise unspecified error while performing the operation.
FUCHSIA_ERROR(INTERNAL,             1)

// ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED: The operation is not implemented, supported, or enabled.
FUCHSIA_ERROR(NOT_SUPPORTED,        2)

// ERR_NO_RESOURCES: The system was not able to allocate some resource needed for the operation.
FUCHSIA_ERROR(NO_RESOURCES,         5)

// ERR_NO_MEMORY: The system was not able to allocate memory needed for the operation.
FUCHSIA_ERROR(NO_MEMORY,            4)

// ======= Parameter errors =======
// ERR_INVALID_ARGS: an argument is invalid, ex. null pointer
FUCHSIA_ERROR(INVALID_ARGS,        10)

// ERR_WRONG_TYPE: The subject of the operation is the wrong type to perform the operation.
// Example: Attempting a message_read on a thread handle.
FUCHSIA_ERROR(WRONG_TYPE,          54)

// ERR_BAD_SYSCALL: The specified syscall number is invalid.
FUCHSIA_ERROR(BAD_SYSCALL,         11)

// ERR_BAD_HANDLE: A specified handle value does not refer to a handle.
FUCHSIA_ERROR(BAD_HANDLE,          12)

// ERR_OUT_OF_RANGE: An argument is outside the valid range for this operation.
FUCHSIA_ERROR(OUT_OF_RANGE,        13)

// ERR_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL: A caller provided buffer is too small for this operation.
FUCHSIA_ERROR(BUFFER_TOO_SMALL,    14)

// ======= Precondition or state errors =======
// ERR_BAD_STATE: operation failed because the current state of the object does not allow it,
// or a precondition of the operation is not satisfied
FUCHSIA_ERROR(BAD_STATE,           20)

// ERR_NOT_FOUND: The requested entity is not found.
FUCHSIA_ERROR(NOT_FOUND,            3)

// ERR_ALREADY_EXISTS: An object with the specified identifier already exists.
// Example: Attempting to create a file when a file already exists with that name.
FUCHSIA_ERROR(ALREADY_EXISTS,      15)

// ERR_ALREADY_BOUND: The operation failed because the named entity is already owned or controlled
// by another entity. The operation could succeed later if the current owner releases the entity.
FUCHSIA_ERROR(ALREADY_BOUND,       16)

// ERR_TIMED_OUT: The time limit for the operation elapsed before the operation completed.
FUCHSIA_ERROR(TIMED_OUT,           23)

// ERR_HANDLE_CLOSED: a handle being waited on was closed
FUCHSIA_ERROR(HANDLE_CLOSED,       24)

// ERR_REMOTE_CLOSED: The operation failed because the remote end of the subject of the operation
// was closed.
FUCHSIA_ERROR(REMOTE_CLOSED,       25)

// ERR_UNAVAILABLE: The subject of the operation is currently unable to perform the operation.
// Note: This is used when there's no direct way for the caller to observe when the subject will
// be able to perform the operation and should thus retry.
FUCHSIA_ERROR(UNAVAILABLE,         26)    // NEW

// ERR_SHOULD_WAIT: The operation cannot be performed currently but potentially could succeed if
// the caller waits for a prerequisite to be satisfied, for example waiting for a handle to be
// readable or writable.
// Example: Attempting to read from a message pipe that has no messages waiting but has an open
// remote will return **SHOULD\_WAIT**. Attempting to read from a message pipe that has no
// messages waiting and has a closed remote end will return **REMOTE\_CLOSED**.
FUCHSIA_ERROR(SHOULD_WAIT,         27)

// ======= Permission check errors =======
// ERR_ACCESS_DENIED: The caller did not have permission to perform the specified operation.
FUCHSIA_ERROR(ACCESS_DENIED,       30)

// ======= Input-output errors =======
// ERR_IO: Otherwise unspecified error occurred during I/O.
FUCHSIA_ERROR(IO,                  40)

// ERR_REFUSED: The entity the I/O operation is being performed on rejected the operation.
// Example: an I2C device NAK'ing a transaction or a disk controller rejecting an invalid command.
FUCHSIA_ERROR(IO_REFUSED,          41)

// ERR_IO_DATA_INTEGRITY: The data in the operation failed an integrity check and is possibly
// corrupted.
// Example: CRC or Parity error.
FUCHSIA_ERROR(IO_DATA_INTEGRITY,   42)

// ERR_IO_DATA_LOSS: The data in the operation is currently unavailable and may be permanently
// lost.
// Example: A disk block is irrecoverably damaged.
